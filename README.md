# Chatbot backend template
+ This simple chatbot backend template is revised and simplified from my work project
    + The core analysis model is Sentence BERT, which embeds user input for calculating similarities between embedded vectors of questions stored in our relational database
    + The model is simple and perhaps out-of-date since the project was started more than 3 years ago
    + Backend framework: FastAPI
    + Services are deployed in Docker containers
